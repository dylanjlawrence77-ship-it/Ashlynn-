# Ashlynn Audit

## Launch Statement

Welcome to **Ashlynn Audit**â€”an autonomous, AI-powered transparency dashboard for the LA homeless non-profit sector. Designed and built by Dylan Lawrence, this tool exposes fraud, waste, and abuse, and autonomously alerts key officials (Mayor, Governor, President, County Board of Supervisors) when compelling evidence is detected.

## Features

- **Autonomous Audit Engine**  
  Continuously scans public records, financials, contracts, and media for fraud, waste, and abuse.

- **Real-Time Dashboard**  
  Visualizes key findings, flagged individuals and organizations, and evidence chains.

- **Automatic Official Notification**  
  Wakes up and sends alerts to the Mayor, Governor, President, and County Supervisors as soon as significant findings are detectedâ€”no manual trigger needed.

- **Public Comments & Requests**  
  Anyone can submit audit requests, share comments, and interact with the dashboard.

- **Evidence & Transparency**  
  All findings backed by verifiable data, with links and documentation for prosecution and journalism.

- **Players Exposed**  
  Lists individuals and organizations implicated in fraud, with their roles, status, and evidence.

- **24/7 Control**  
  Includes Start/Stop button to run the audit engine continuously or pause as needed.

## Use Cases

- **Citizens:**  
  Quickly see which organizations and individuals are flagged, submit requests, and help drive accountability.

- **Journalists:**  
  Access real-time evidence for investigations and reporting; get notified automatically when new stories break.

- **Officials:**  
  Receive autonomous notifications (Mayor, Governor, President, County Board) for immediate action.

  Track systemic issues and advocate for policy change with clear, actionable data.

## Inspiration

> _"Ashlynn Audit was born from my own experience: I lived through the debacle of LAâ€™s homeless non-profit systemâ€”experiencing fraud, negligence, and waste firsthand, while being homeless and still homeless. I saw millions spent with little real impact. This tool is for everyone who needs the truth, accountability, and a way out."_
